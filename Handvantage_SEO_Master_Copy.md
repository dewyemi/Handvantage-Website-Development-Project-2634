## 2. The Problem (The Dual Squeeze)
**H2:** The Two Forces Killing Your Margins
**Body:**
You don't need "Better Security." You need **Viability Engineering**.
Most mid-market firms are drowning in tools but starving for speed.

**The Fortress (Security Pressure)**
Regulators, Insurance, Clients. They all want more locks, more gates, more friction. Your team is drowning in MFA prompts and VPN logins. Work slows to a crawl.
*   **The Cost:** Security Fatigue leads to shadow IT and bypassed controls.

**The Factory (Efficiency Pressure)**
The Board, The Market, Competitors. They demand speed, lower costs, faster shipping. You skip security steps to meet deadlines.
*   **The Cost:** One breach wipes out 5 years of profit. The balance is broken.
