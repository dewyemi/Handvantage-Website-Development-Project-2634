# The Dual Squeeze Manifesto
## Why "Good Security" is Killing Your Business

**By Handvantage**

### 1. The Lie We Were Sold
For the last decade, the cybersecurity industry has sold us a lie: "More is Better."
More tools. More alerts. More complexity.
They told us that if we just bought one more firewall, one more EDR agent, one more SIEM, we would be safe.

They were wrong.

### 2. The Reality: The Dual Squeeze
Today, the modern firm is being crushed by two opposing forces.

**Force 1: The Fortress (The Pressure to be Safe)**
Regulators, cyber insurance carriers, and anxious clients are demanding perfection. They want Zero Trust. They want 24/7 monitoring. They want a fortress.

**Force 2: The Factory (The Pressure to be Fast)**
The market doesn't care about your firewall. It cares about your shipping speed. Your Board demands efficiency. Your competitors are moving faster. They want a factory.

**The Conflict:**
When you strengthen the Fortress, you slow down the Factory.
When you speed up the Factory, you weaken the Fortress.

This is the **Dual Squeeze**. And it is killing your margins.

### 3. The Solution: Viability Engineering
We do not believe in "Security" as a standalone department. We believe in **Viability**.

Viability is the mathematical balance between Risk and Speed.
*   Security says: "Block everything." (Safe, but bankrupt).
*   Operations says: "Allow everything." (Fast, but breached).
*   **Viability says: "Secure the flow of revenue."**

### 4. Our Promise
We do not sell tools. We install an Operating System designed to harmonize these two forces.
We use AI to automate the Fortress so the Factory can run at full speed.

We are Handvantage.
**Secure the Fortress. Speed up the Factory.**
