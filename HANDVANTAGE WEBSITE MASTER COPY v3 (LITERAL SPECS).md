    ```text
    Buying a Ferrari (Top-Tier MDR) doesn't make you a race car driver.
    If you hand the keys to an amateur (Internal Hire) or a mailbox (Bad MSP), you will crash.

    A tool without a master is just a noise generator.
    You are drowning in alerts because you lack the human layer to filter them.
