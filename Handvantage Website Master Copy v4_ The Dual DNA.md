*   **Left Column (The Breach):**
    *   **Icon:** Red Siren.

*   **Right Column (The Drag):**
    *   **Icon:** Rusty Anchor.
    *   **Text:** "Your engineers are drowning. Password resets. Evidence collection. Manual onboarding. The 'grunt work' is killing your profit."

### The Solution (The Pilot + The Engineer)

## 5. The FAQ (Objection Killers)

*   **Q: Are you an MSP?**
    *   **A:** No. MSPs fix printers and charge by the hour. We are a **Viability Partner**. We charge for *Outcomes* (Safety + Speed). We don't want your tickets; we want to *automate* them away.
*   **Q: Do I need to buy new tools?**
    *   **A:** No. We are **Agnostic**. We fly your jet (CrowdStrike, SentinelOne, Microsoft). If you don't have one, we'll bring ours at cost.
*   **Q: What can you automate?**
    *   **A:** Anything with an API. Onboarding, Offboarding, Access Reviews, Phishing Triage, Cloud Compliance Checks. If a human does it more than twice, we automate it.
