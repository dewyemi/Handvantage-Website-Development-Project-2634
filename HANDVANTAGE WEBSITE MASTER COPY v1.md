## 2. HOME PAGE (THE LANDING ZONE)

### A. The Hero Section (Above the Fold)
**Headline (H1):**
> **DON'T BUY THE JET.**
> **HIRE THE PILOT.**

**Sub-Headline (H2):**
> **Service Is The Asset.**
> You have the tools (MDR, EDR, Compliance). But do you have the 24/7 team to run them? We are the Elite Service Layer that makes your security stack actually work.

**The "Dual Squeeze" Tagline (Signature):**
> **SECURE THE FORTRESS. SPEED UP THE FACTORY.**

**Primary CTA Button:**
> [ CALCULATE YOUR SAVINGS ]
> *Micro-copy below button:* "See how much you save by replacing the $180k Internal Hire."

**Visual Directive:**
*   Background: A schematic of a complex engine or cockpit HUD.
*   Hero Image: A "Pilot" figure (abstract or real) calmly managing a chaotic dashboard of alerts.

### B. The "Service Gap" Section (The Problem)
**Headline:**
> **THE "EMPTY SEAT" PROBLEM**

**Body Copy:**
> Buying a Ferrari (Top-Tier MDR) doesn't make you a race car driver. If you hand the keys to an amateur (Internal Hire) or a mailbox (Bad MSP), you will crash.
>
> A tool without a master is just a noise generator. You are drowning in alerts because you lack the human layer to filter them.

| **Copy:** "If the answer is 'No one' or 'My IT Director,' you are already breached. We provide the 24/7 Human Shield." | **Copy:** "Internal hires sleep. They take vacations. We automate the grunt work and replace the expensive headcount. We pay for ourselves." |
