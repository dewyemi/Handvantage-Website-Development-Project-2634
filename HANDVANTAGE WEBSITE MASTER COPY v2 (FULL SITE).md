## 3. PAGE 2: THE SERVICE (SOLUTIONS)
**Headline:**
> **WE FLY ANY JET.**

**Sub-Headline:**
> You own the stack. We own the outcome.
> We are the "Service Layer" that sits on top of your existing tools to provide 24/7 protection and operational speed.

### Section A: The Pilot (Security Operations)
**Headline:** "The 24/7 Human Shield"
**Copy:**
> "Tools don't catch hackers. People do."
>
> Your MDR (Arctic Wolf, CrowdStrike) is just a sensor. It beeps when it sees smoke.
> **We are the Fire Department.**
> We don't just forward the alert; we kick down the door, put out the fire, and rebuild the wall before you even wake up.
>
> *   **24/7 Eyes on Glass:** Real humans, not bots.
> *   **15-Minute Response:** Guaranteed.
> *   **Vendor Agnostic:** We speak every language (SentinelOne, Defender, Vanta).

### Section B: The Mechanic (IT Automation)
**Headline:** "The Efficiency Engine"
**Copy:**
> "Security shouldn't slow you down. It should speed you up."
>
> We don't just watch the screen; we tune the engine. We automate the "boring work" that burns out your internal team.
>
> *   **Zero-Touch Onboarding:** New hires are productive on Minute 1.
> *   **Automated Patching:** We close the holes so you don't have to.
> *   **Compliance Evidence:** We collect the screenshots for the auditor.

## 4. PAGE 3: THE DOCTRINE (MANIFESTO)
**Headline:**
> **THE PILOT'S CODE.**

**Sub-Headline:**
> Why we exist. Why the old model is broken. Why you need a Pilot.

### Tenet 1: The "Pilot vs. Plane" Fallacy
> The industry wants you to believe that if you buy a better plane (Tool), you won't crash.
> This is a lie.
> A Ferrari driven by an amateur will crash faster than a Toyota driven by a pro.
> **We believe in the Driver.**

### Tenet 2: The "Internal Hire" Trap
> Hiring a CISO for $180k to watch a screen is a waste of capital.
> Humans sleep. Humans churn. Humans have bias.
> **We believe in the Hive Mind.** A 24/7 team that never sleeps and learns from 500+ clients instantly.

### Tenet 3: The "Agnostic" Pledge
> We will never sell you a tool just because we get a commission.
> We sit on **YOUR** side of the table. If your current stack works, we keep it. If it sucks, we tell you.
> **We believe in Truth.**

## 5. PAGE 4: THE MATH (CALCULATOR)
**Headline:**
> **THE COST OF SLEEP.**

**Sub-Headline:**
> Calculate how much you save by hiring a Pilot instead of a CISO.

### The Logic Block (Interactive)
*   **Input:** "Annual Cost of Internal Team" (Default: $180k x 3 = $540k for 24/7).
*   **Input:** "Annual Cost of SaaS Waste" (Default: 30% of budget).
*   **Handvantage Fee:** (Hidden Variable: ~30% of Internal Cost).
*   **Result:** "You save **$350,000/year** by switching to Handvantage."

**The "Greed" Hook:**
> "That is 3 extra engineers you could hire to build your product."

## 6. PAGE 5: FAQ (OBJECTION KILLERS)
**Headline:**
> **CLEARING THE AIR.**

**Q: "Do you replace my IT team?"**
> **A:** No. We liberate them. We take the "Night Watch" and the "Grunt Work" so they can focus on strategic projects. We make them look like heroes.

**Q: "Do I need to switch tools?"**
> **A:** Rarely. We are agnostic. We likely support what you already have. If you are using "Shelf-Ware," we will help you cut it.

**Q: "Are you an MSP?"**
> **A:** No. An MSP fixes printers and forwards emails. We are a **Service Layer**. We are the Special Forces that handle the high-stakes operations (Security & Automation).
