**Title:** Beyond IAM: Why You Need an Identity Fabric

**Body:**

For years, we've relied on Identity and Access Management (IAM) tools to manage user access. But in a world of cloud, mobile, and remote work, traditional IAM is no longer enough. The result? A fragmented identity landscape that's difficult to manage and secure.

An Identity Fabric is the next evolution of IAM. It's a strategic approach that unifies identity management across all your environments, from on-prem to the cloud. By focusing on cohesive functional outcomes rather than individual tools, an Identity Fabric provides a single, consistent way to manage and secure all identities—human and machine.

It's time to move beyond the limitations of traditional IAM. It's time for an Identity Fabric.

**Title:** Continuous Access Evaluation: The Heart of the Identity Fabric

**Body:**

In a Zero Trust world, trust is never assumed. That's why Continuous Access Evaluation is so critical. It's the process of continuously verifying the identity and context of every user and device, in real-time.

The Identity Fabric enables Continuous Access Evaluation by providing a unified view of identity and access across your entire ecosystem. It ingests signals from a wide range of sources—identity providers, endpoint security tools, threat intelligence feeds—to make dynamic, risk-based access decisions.

With Continuous Access Evaluation, you can move from a static, perimeter-based security model to a dynamic, identity-centric one. It's the key to achieving true Zero Trust.

**Poll:** What's the biggest challenge you face in managing identities across your organization?

*   A) Multiple, disconnected identity systems
*   B) Lack of visibility into user access
*   C) Securing non-human identities (e.g., APIs, service accounts)
*   D) All of the above

**First Comment:**

Managing identities in a hybrid, multi-cloud world is a massive challenge. An Identity Fabric helps you solve this by creating a unified layer of identity management that spans all your environments. It's the foundation for a modern, identity-centric security strategy.
