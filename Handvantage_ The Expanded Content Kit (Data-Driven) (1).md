### **Section 1: The Pilot (Security Operations)**
**Headline:** 24/7 Eyes on Glass. Because Hackers Don't Sleep.
**Sub-Headline:** The average cost of downtime is now **$9,000 per minute** [1]. You cannot afford to blink.

**Feature 1: Managed Detection & Response (MDR)**

**Feature 2: Active Remediation**

**Feature 3: Vendor Agnostic Defense**
*   **The Reality:** Most MSPs are just reselling software to hit a quota.

**Feature 2: The "Efficiency Hunter" Audit**
*   **The Stat:** The average enterprise wastes **30% of its SaaS spend** on unused licenses.
*   **The Solution:** We audit your stack monthly. We find the zombies, cancel the shelfware, and negotiate the contracts.

## PAGE: MANIFESTO (The Doctrine)

### **The "Service-First" Revolution**
**Headline:** The IT Industry is Broken. We Are Here to Fix It.

**The $180k Lie:**
The industry tells you to hire an internal CISO.
**The Truth:** The average CISO salary is **$180,000+** [5], and they burn out in 18 months.
**The Handvantage Way:** For a fraction of that cost, you get an entire *team*—SOC analysts, automation engineers, and compliance experts—who never sleep and never quit.

**The "Tool Tax" Scam:**
Most MSPs make their money by marking up software. They are incentivized to sell you *more tools*, not *better outcomes*.
**The Handvantage Way:** We charge a flat fee for *service*. We are incentivized to make you efficient, because if you break, we have to fix it.

**The "Dual DNA" Philosophy:**
You cannot be secure if you are inefficient. You cannot be efficient if you are hacked.
We are the only partner who solves both. We are the **Pilot** (Security) and the **Engineer** (Automation).
