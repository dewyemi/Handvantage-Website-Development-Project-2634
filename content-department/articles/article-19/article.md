# Volt Typhoon and Beyond: How Nation-States are Pre-Positioning in Your Critical Infrastructure

In the world of cybersecurity, we often focus on the threats that are right in front of us—the ransomware attacks that encrypt our data, the phishing emails that steal our credentials, the denial-of-service attacks that take our websites offline. But there is a new and far more insidious threat that is lurking in the shadows of our networks, a threat that is not designed to cause immediate disruption, but to lie in wait, ready to be activated at a moment’s notice.

This is the threat of **pre-positioning**, and it is the calling card of a new breed of nation-state actor. One of the most prominent examples of this new threat is a group that has been dubbed **Volt Typhoon** by Microsoft and the U.S. government. This is a state-sponsored actor from the People’s Republic of China (PRC) that has been observed targeting a wide range of U.S. critical infrastructure sectors, from communications and transportation to energy and water.

This article will explore the threat of Volt Typhoon, the techniques they use to remain hidden, and the broader implications of this new era of nation-state pre-positioning.

## The Goal: Pre-Positioning for Future Conflict

The primary goal of Volt Typhoon is not immediate disruption or financial gain. It is to establish long-term, persistent access to critical infrastructure networks that can be used to disrupt essential services in the event of a geopolitical conflict. This is a profound and deeply concerning shift in the strategic landscape of cybersecurity.

We are no longer just dealing with criminals who are after our money; we are dealing with nation-states who are preparing for a future conflict. And they are using our critical infrastructure as a digital battlefield.

## The Technique: Living Off the Land (LOTL)

What makes Volt Typhoon and other actors like them so difficult to detect is their use of a technique known as **living off the land (LOTL)**. Instead of using custom malware or sophisticated zero-day exploits, they use the legitimate, built-in tools that are already present in the target environment. This includes tools like:

*   **PowerShell:** A powerful scripting language that is built into all modern versions of Windows.
*   **WMI:** The Windows Management Instrumentation, a set of tools for managing Windows devices.
*   **Legitimate remote access tools:** Tools like Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) that are used by administrators for legitimate purposes.

By using these legitimate tools, the attackers are able to blend in with normal administrative activity, making them incredibly difficult to detect. They are hiding in plain sight.

## The 5-Year Dwell Time: A Stealthy and Persistent Threat

The stealth and persistence of this threat is truly alarming. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has confirmed that Volt Typhoon has maintained access to some victim environments for **at least five years** [1]. This means that they have been lurking in the shadows of our critical infrastructure networks for years, waiting for the right moment to strike.

This is a sobering reminder of the scale and sophistication of the threat we are facing. We are not just dealing with smash-and-grab criminals; we are dealing with patient, well-resourced, and highly skilled adversaries who are playing a long game.

## Conclusion: The Silent Threat

The rise of nation-state pre-positioning is a paradigm shift in the world of cybersecurity. It requires us to rethink our assumptions about the nature of the threat and the goals of our adversaries. We can no longer afford to focus only on the threats that are making noise. We must also be prepared to hunt for the silent threats that are lurking in the shadows of our networks.

The most dangerous adversary may not be the one demanding a ransom today, but the one quietly waiting in your network for a conflict tomorrow.
