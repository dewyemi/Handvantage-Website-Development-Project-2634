**Post Text:**

We've all heard the term Cybersecurity Mesh Architecture (CSMA), but how do you actually build one? It's not about buying a single product; it's about implementing three critical layers.

In my latest article, I do a deep dive into the practical components of CSMA 3.0.

We cover:

- **SAIL (Security Analytics & Intelligence):** The "brain" that unifies your security data.
- **PPPM (Policy, Posture & Playbook Management):** The "governance engine" for consistent control.
- **IML (Infrastructure Management Layer):** The "hands" that provide essential context.

If you're a security architect or engineer ready to move beyond the theory of CSMA and into the practical reality of building an integrated defense, this is for you.
