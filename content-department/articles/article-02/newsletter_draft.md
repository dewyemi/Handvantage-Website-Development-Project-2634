# Newsletter Draft: The 3 New Layers of CSMA 3.0

**Subject: Beyond the Hype: The 3 Layers of a Real CSMA**

Hi {FirstName},

Last week, we talked about CSMA as a philosophy. This week, we get practical.

How do you actually build a Cybersecurity Mesh? It comes down to three new, critical layers that work together like a team of medical specialists for your organization.

This week on the blog, I’m doing a deep dive into these layers: **The 3 New Layers of CSMA 3.0: A Deep Dive into SAIL, PPPM, and IML**.

In this tutorial, we explore:

*   **SAIL:** The “brain” that provides centralized analytics and intelligence.
*   **PPPM:** The “governance engine” that centralizes policy and posture.
*   **IML:** The “hands” that provide critical infrastructure context.

I believe understanding these layers is the key to moving from theory to practice. What are your thoughts on this model? I’d love to hear them.

Best,
