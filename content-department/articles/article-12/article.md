# The Gains Analysis Framework: A Practical Guide to Measuring Automation ROI

As security leaders, we know that automation is essential. We know that it can help us to reduce analyst burnout, improve our security posture, and keep pace with the modern threat landscape. But knowing this and convincing our CFO to invest in it are two very different things.

For too long, we have been trying to justify automation with vague promises of “efficiency.” But “efficiency” is not a word that resonates with a CFO. They want to see a clear, data-driven business case that shows a tangible return on investment (ROI). This is where many of us fall short.

To solve this problem, I’ve developed a simple, four-step framework that I call **Gains Analysis**. It’s a practical guide to measuring the ROI of your security automation projects and translating it into a language that any business leader can understand.

## The “Efficiency” Trap

The biggest mistake I see security leaders make when trying to justify automation is falling into the “efficiency” trap. They go to their CFO and say, “We need to invest in this new SOAR platform because it will make our team more efficient.” But what does “efficient” actually mean? How do you measure it? How do you translate it into dollars and cents?

Without a clear, data-driven answer to these questions, your business case is likely to fall on deaf ears. The Gains Analysis Framework is designed to help you avoid this trap and build a business case that is both compelling and credible.

## The Gains Analysis Framework

The Gains Analysis Framework is a simple, four-step process for measuring and communicating the ROI of your automation projects:

| Step | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Identify** | Identify a repetitive, manual task that is consuming a significant amount of your team’s time. |
| **Measure Pain** | Quantify the cost of the manual process. |
| **Automate** | Implement an automation playbook to handle the task. |
| **Measure Gain** | Measure the time saved and translate it into a direct cost savings. |

Let’s walk through a concrete example to see how it works.

### Step 1: Identify

Let’s say your SOC team is spending a significant amount of time triaging phishing alerts. This is a common problem in many organizations, and it’s a perfect candidate for automation.

### Step 2: Measure Pain

Next, we need to quantify the pain of this manual process. Let’s say you have a team of five SOC analysts, and they each spend about 15 minutes triaging each phishing alert. If your organization receives 160 phishing alerts per day, that’s a total of 40 hours of work per day, or the equivalent of five full-time employees, just triaging phishing alerts.

Now, let’s translate this into a cost. If the average salary of a SOC analyst is $100,000 per year, then the cost of this manual process is a staggering $500,000 per year.

### Step 3: Automate

Now, we implement an automation playbook to handle the triage of these phishing alerts. The playbook can automatically:

*   Extract indicators of compromise (IOCs) from the email.
*   Check the IOCs against threat intelligence feeds.
*   Detonate any attachments in a sandbox.
*   Determine if the email is malicious or benign.

### Step 4: Measure Gain

Finally, we measure the gain. Let’s say the automation playbook is able to resolve 90% of the phishing alerts automatically, reducing the average triage time from 15 minutes to just 1 minute. This means that we have saved 14 minutes per alert, or a total of 37.3 hours per day. This is a 93% reduction in the time spent on this task.

Now, we can translate this time savings into a direct cost savings. By saving 37.3 hours per day, we have freed up the equivalent of 4.6 full-time employees, for a total cost savings of **$460,000 per year**. This is a hard, measurable ROI that your CFO can take to the bank.

## Conclusion: From Vague Promise to Data-Driven Business Case

The Gains Analysis Framework is a simple but powerful tool for any security leader who is struggling to get budget for automation. It provides a structured way to move beyond vague promises of “efficiency” and build a data-driven business case that clearly demonstrates the financial value of your automation projects.

Gains Analysis transforms the conversation about automation from a vague promise of ‘efficiency’ into a concrete, data-driven business case that any CFO can understand.
