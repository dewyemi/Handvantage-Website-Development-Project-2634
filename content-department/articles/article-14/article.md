# The Modern Ransomware Kill Chain: How Attackers Target Your Backups

For years, the ransomware kill chain was a relatively simple and predictable process. Attackers would gain a foothold in a network, encrypt as much data as they could, and then demand a ransom. But as security defenses have improved, attackers have been forced to evolve. They have developed a new and far more dangerous kill chain—one that has a single, primary objective: to destroy your backups.

Why? Because they know that if they can eliminate your ability to recover, they can force you to pay the ransom. This is the new reality of modern ransomware, and it’s a reality that many organizations are still dangerously unprepared for.

This article will walk you through the modern ransomware kill chain, with a specific focus on the new and critical stage of backup discovery and destruction.

## The New Kill Chain: A Focus on Backups

The modern ransomware kill chain is a multi-stage process that can take place over a period of weeks or even months. It’s a slow, deliberate, and methodical attack that is designed to maximize the chances of a successful payout.

Here are the key stages of the modern ransomware kill chain:

1.  **Initial Compromise:** The attack begins, as always, with an initial compromise. This could be a phishing email, a software vulnerability, or a compromised credential.
2.  **Reconnaissance and Lateral Movement:** Once inside the network, the attackers begin a process of reconnaissance and lateral movement. They use legitimate administrative tools—a technique known as “living off the land”—to map out the network, identify high-value targets, and gain access to privileged credentials.
3.  **Backup Discovery and Destruction:** This is the new and critical stage of the modern ransomware kill chain. The attackers use their privileged access to find and destroy your backups. They will delete backup files, reconfigure backup jobs, and disable backup software. Their goal is to leave you with no other option but to pay the ransom.
4.  **Data Exfiltration:** Before they encrypt your data, the attackers will often exfiltrate a large volume of sensitive data. This serves as a second form of leverage, as they can threaten to release the data publicly if the ransom is not paid.
5.  **Encryption and Ransom:** Finally, with the backups destroyed and the data exfiltrated, the attackers will encrypt your production data and deliver their ransom note.

## The 94% Problem: The Targeting of Backups

The targeting of backups is not a rare or isolated phenomenon. It is the new normal. A recent report from Veeam found that a staggering **94% of ransomware attacks target backups** [1]. This is a clear and undeniable trend that has massive implications for our security strategies.

It means that our traditional, perimeter-based security defenses are no longer sufficient. We can no longer assume that our backups are safe just because they are on a separate network segment. We must assume that the attackers are already in our network and that they will actively try to destroy our backups.

## The 57% Data Loss Problem

The consequences of this new kill chain are devastating. The same Veeam report found that **57% of organizations that suffer a ransomware attack recover less than 50% of their data** [1]. This is a direct result of the attackers successfully destroying backups. When the backups are gone, the data is gone.

This is a catastrophic outcome for any organization. It can lead to massive financial losses, reputational damage, and even business failure.

## Conclusion: A New Defense Strategy

The modern ransomware kill chain is a game-changer. It requires a fundamental shift in how we think about security and data protection. We can no longer afford to treat our backups as an afterthought. They must be a central and critical component of our security strategy.

In the modern ransomware attack, your production data is no longer the primary target; your backups are. Your defense strategy must evolve accordingly.
