**Post Text:**

Are you tired of the constant alert fatigue and integration headaches from a sea of disconnected security tools? The traditional "castle-and-moat" approach is broken.

In my latest article, I break down Cybersecurity Mesh Architecture (CSMA) and provide a practical framework for building a truly integrated security ecosystem.

We cover:

- Why the average SOC is drowning in alerts (960 per day!) and how CSMA helps.
- The 4 foundational layers of a mesh architecture: SAIL, Identity Fabric, PPPM, and Dashboards.
