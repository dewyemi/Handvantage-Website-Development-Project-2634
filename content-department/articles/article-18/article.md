# A CISO’s Guide to OT Security: Bridging the Gap Between Engineering and IT

For many Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs), the world of Operational Technology (OT) is a foreign and intimidating place. It’s a world of programmable logic controllers (PLCs), supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, and a whole host of other acronyms that are not typically part of the CISO’s vocabulary. But as the worlds of IT and OT converge, more and more CISOs are finding themselves responsible for the security of these critical industrial environments.

And it’s a massive challenge. A recent report found that **95% of organizations are moving OT security responsibility to the CISO** [1]. This means that a huge number of CISOs are now on the hook for securing a domain that they may not be familiar with, and one that has a very different culture, a different set of priorities, and a different risk tolerance than the world of IT.

As a CISO who has made this journey myself, I can tell you that the key to success is not to try to impose the IT security mindset on the OT world. It’s to learn to speak the language of engineering and operations, to build trust with your counterparts on the factory floor, and to frame security not as a blocker, but as a critical enabler of safety and reliability.

This guide will provide a practical, real-world roadmap for any CISO who is taking on the challenge of OT security.

## The Culture Clash: Safety vs. Security

The first and most important thing to understand about the OT world is that it has a different set of priorities than the IT world. In IT, we are primarily concerned with the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. In OT, the priorities are **safety, availability, and reliability**. The number one concern of any plant manager is to keep the plant running safely. Anything that threatens to disrupt operations or create a safety risk is going to be met with fierce resistance.

This is the source of the infamous culture clash between IT and OT. The IT security team comes in with their vulnerability scanners and their patch mandates, and the OT team sees them as a threat to the stability and reliability of their systems. They are not wrong. A poorly timed patch or a disruptive vulnerability scan can absolutely cause a critical industrial process to fail, with potentially catastrophic consequences.

## Building Trust: The First Step to Success

Given this culture clash, the first and most important step for any CISO who is taking on OT security is to build trust with the engineering and operations teams. This is not something that can be done overnight. It requires a long-term commitment to listening, learning, and collaboration.

Here are a few practical tips for building trust with your OT counterparts:

*   **Go and see:** Get out of your office and go and see the OT environment for yourself. Walk the factory floor. Talk to the engineers and operators. Understand how they work and what their challenges are.
*   **Listen more than you talk:** In your initial meetings with the OT team, your primary goal should be to listen. Ask them about their concerns, their priorities, and their ideas for how to improve security.
*   **Find a common language:** Learn to speak the language of OT. Instead of talking about “threats” and “vulnerabilities,” talk about “risks to safety” and “impacts on production.”
*   **Start with a small win:** Don’t try to boil the ocean. Start with a small, low-risk project that can deliver a quick win and demonstrate the value of security to the OT team.

## A New Model for Governance: The CeDeSec Pattern

As you begin to build trust and collaboration with the OT team, you can start to introduce a new model for governance that is designed for the unique challenges of the OT environment. I call this the **CeDeSec pattern: Centralized Policy, Decentralized Enforcement**.

In this model, the central security team is responsible for defining the high-level security policies for the organization. But the enforcement of those policies is decentralized and delegated to the local OT teams. This allows you to achieve a consistent security posture across the organization, without creating a central bottleneck or disempowering the local teams.

## Conclusion: A Bridge, Not a Barrier

The convergence of IT and OT is one of the biggest challenges and opportunities facing our industry today. For CISOs, it’s a chance to step up and play a critical role in protecting our nation’s critical infrastructure. But to succeed, we must learn to be a bridge, not a barrier.

To succeed in OT security, a CISO must learn to speak the language of engineering and operations, framing security not as a blocker, but as a critical enabler of safety and reliability.
