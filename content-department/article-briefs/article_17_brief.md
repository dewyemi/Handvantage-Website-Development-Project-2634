> 
> - **Article Number:** 17
> - **Title:** The Air Gap is a Myth: 5 Principles for Modern OT Security
> - **Main Keyword:** Air Gap Security Myth
> - **Other Keywords:** OT security principles, industrial control systems, SCADA security
> - **Article Type:** Listicle
> - **Tone of Voice:** Authoritative
> - **Point of View:** First person singular
> 
> ## 2. Details to Include
> 
> - **Core Concept:** Debunk the concept of the "air gap" with real-world examples (USB drives, vendor laptops, remote access).
> - **5 Principles:** List and explain five core principles for modern OT security (e.g., Assume Breach, Implement an Industrial DMZ, Centralize Policy, etc.).
> - **Closing Sentence:** "Stop trusting the gap and start building a defensible architecture; assume the breach will cross the IT/OT boundary and design your controls accordingly."
> 
> ## 3. Key Insights from Research
> 
> - **The Broken Myth:** The air gap is a dangerous myth that creates a false sense of security. In reality, the gap is constantly being bridged by operational necessities.
> - **The Human Factor:** The human element is a major factor in bridging the air gap, with engineers and technicians often using the same laptops for both IT and OT environments.
> - **Principle 1: Assume Breach:** The foundation of modern OT security is to assume that the IT network is already compromised and that attackers will attempt to cross into the OT environment.
> - **Principle 2: Implement an Industrial DMZ:** Create a buffer zone between the IT and OT networks with strict access controls and monitoring.
> - **Principle 3: Centralize Policy, Decentralize Enforcement (CeDeSec):** Use a centralized policy engine (like the PPPM layer of CSMA) to manage access policies, but enforce them at the local level within the OT network.
> 
> ## 4. Target Audience
> 
> - **Primary:** OT security managers, ICS engineers, and plant operators.
> - **Secondary:** CISOs and IT leaders who are new to the world of OT security.
> 
> ## 5. Lead Magnet Suggestion
> 
> - **Title:** The 5 Principles of Modern OT Security: A Poster
> - **Content:** A one-page, visually appealing poster that summarizes the five principles, suitable for display in an engineering or operations center.
