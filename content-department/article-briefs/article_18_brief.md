## 1. Core AI Parameters

- **Article Number:** 18
- **Title:** A CISO’s Guide to OT Security: Bridging the Gap Between Engineering and IT
- **Main Keyword:** CISO Guide to OT Security
- **Other Keywords:** OT security leadership, IT OT collaboration, industrial cybersecurity strategy
- **Article Type:** How-to guide
- **Tone of Voice:** Encouraging
- **Point of View:** First person singular

## 2. Details to Include

- **Core Concept:** Focus on the importance of communication, culture, and building trust between the CISO's security team and the engineering/operations team.
- **Key Message:** Explain the need for CISOs to understand and respect the priorities of the OT world: safety and reliability.
- **Closing Sentence:** "To succeed in OT security, a CISO must learn to speak the language of engineering and operations, framing security not as a blocker, but as a critical enabler of safety and reliability."

## 3. Key Insights from Research

- **The Culture Clash:** There is often a cultural clash between IT and OT. IT prioritizes confidentiality and data security, while OT prioritizes safety, availability, and reliability. A successful CISO must bridge this gap.
- **The 95% Shift:** 95% of organizations are moving OT security responsibility to the CISO. This means that many CISOs are now responsible for a domain they may not be familiar with.
- **Building Trust:** The first step for a CISO is to build trust with the engineering team. This involves listening to their concerns, understanding their processes, and demonstrating that security can improve safety and reliability, not hinder it.
- **The Language of OT:** CISOs need to learn to speak the language of OT. Instead of talking about "threats" and "vulnerabilities," they should talk about "risks to safety" and "impacts on production."

## 4. Target Audience

- **Primary:** CISOs and senior security leaders who are taking on responsibility for OT security.
- **Secondary:** Plant managers, engineering leaders, and OT professionals who need to collaborate with the CISO.

## 5. Lead Magnet Suggestion

- **Title:** The IT/OT Communication Playbook
- **Content:** A short guide with practical tips for CISOs on how to communicate effectively with engineering teams, including a glossary of common OT terms and a list of conversation starters.
