> ## 1. Core AI Parameters
> 
> - **Article Number:** 20
> - **Title:** What is a CNAPP? A Practical Guide to Cloud-Native Application Protection Platforms
> - **Main Keyword:** What is a CNAPP
> - **Other Keywords:** cloud security, CSPM, CWPP, CIEM, cloud native security
> - **Article Type:** How-to guide
> - **Tone of Voice:** Informational
> - **Point of View:** First person singular
> 
> ## 2. Details to Include
> 
> - **Core Concept:** Explain what a CNAPP is by breaking down its core components (CSPM, CWPP, CIEM, etc.).
> - **Analogy:** Use an analogy to explain why this convergence of capabilities is necessary for cloud-native security.
> - **Closing Sentence:** "CNAPP is not just another cloud security tool; it is the architectural convergence required to manage the complexity and scale of modern cloud-native environments."
> 
> ## 3. Key Insights from Research
> 
> - **The Problem of Tool Sprawl:** The average organization uses over 75 security tools. In the cloud, this problem is even worse, with separate tools for posture management (CSPM), workload protection (CWPP), and identity (CIEM). This creates gaps and complexity.
> - **The CNAPP Solution:** A CNAPP integrates these capabilities into a single, unified platform. This provides a holistic view of cloud risk, from development to runtime.
> - **CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management):** Scans for misconfigurations and compliance violations in cloud infrastructure.
> - **CWPP (Cloud Workload Protection Platform):** Protects running workloads (containers, serverless functions) from threats.
> - **CIEM (Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management):** Manages and enforces least privilege for cloud identities.
> 
> ## 4. Target Audience
> 
> - **Primary:** Cloud Security Architects, DevSecOps engineers, and anyone responsible for securing cloud-native applications.
> - **Secondary:** CISOs and IT leaders who need to understand the modern cloud security landscape.
> 
> ## 5. Lead Magnet Suggestion
> 
> - **Title:** The CNAPP Evaluation Checklist
> - **Content:** A checklist of key features and capabilities to look for when evaluating a CNAPP solution, helping organizations choose the right platform for their needs.
