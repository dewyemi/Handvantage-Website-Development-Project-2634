> 
> - **Article Number:** 16
> - **Title:** The 75% Problem: Why Your IT Network is Your Biggest OT Security Risk
> - **Main Keyword:** IT OT Convergence Security
> - **Other Keywords:** OT security risk, industrial cybersecurity, Stuxnet
> - **Article Type:** Opinion piece
> - **Tone of Voice:** Urgent
> - **Point of View:** First person singular
> 
> ## 2. Details to Include
> 
> - **Core Concept:** Cite the 75% statistic from Fortinet, which states that 75% of OT security incidents originate from the IT network.
> - **Historical Context:** Connect this to the Stuxnet attack path to show that this is not a new problem.
> - **Closing Sentence:** "Securing your OT environment doesn’t start at the factory floor; it starts in your corporate data center, because that’s where your adversary will."
> 
> ## 3. Key Insights from Research
> 
> - **The IT/OT Superhighway:** The convergence of IT and OT has created a "superhighway of risk" from the corporate network directly into the industrial control environment.
> - **The 83% Figure:** Reinforce the 75% statistic with the 83% figure from the Pillar 4 document, which also states that most OT breaches originate in the IT environment.
> - **The Stuxnet Lesson:** The Stuxnet attack, which occurred over a decade ago, used this exact path: it moved from the IT network to the OT network via a USB drive. This demonstrates that the industry has been slow to learn this lesson.
> - **The Architectural Flaw:** The core problem is a fundamental architectural flaw: a high-trust relationship between the low-trust IT environment and the high-trust OT environment. This violates the principles of Zero Trust.
> 
> ## 4. Target Audience
> 
> - **Primary:** CISOs, Plant Managers, and industrial control system (ICS) engineers.
