> 
> ## 1. Core AI Parameters
> 
> - **Article Number:** 13
> - **Title:** Why Your Disaster Recovery Plan is Obsolete (And Why You Need a Resilience Plan)
> - **Main Keyword:** Disaster Recovery vs Cyber Resilience
> - **Other Keywords:** business continuity, BCDR, resilience planning
> - **Article Type:** Opinion piece
> - **Tone of Voice:** Authoritative
> - **Point of View:** First person singular
> 
> ## 2. Details to Include
> 
> - **Core Concept:** Contrast the two concepts: Disaster Recovery (DR) is about restoring the past; Cyber Resilience is about adapting to ensure a future.
> - **Reference:** Reference NIST SP 800-160 Vol. 2 for the definition of resilience.
> - **Closing Sentence:** "Disaster recovery is about restoring the past; cyber resilience is about ensuring you have a future."
> 
> ## 3. Key Insights from Research
> 
> - **The Flaw in DR:** Traditional DR assumes a benign failure (e.g., hardware failure, natural disaster) and that backups are safe. Modern ransomware attacks specifically target and destroy backups, rendering DR obsolete.
> - **The 94% Problem:** 94% of ransomware attacks target backups. This means that a traditional DR plan is likely to fail when it's needed most.
> - **The Resilience Mindset:** Cyber resilience assumes a hostile actor is already in the network. It focuses on the ability to continue operating during an attack and to recover in a verified, malware-free way.
> - **Key Components of Resilience:** This includes immutable backups, an isolated recovery environment (air-gapped), and automated testing of backup integrity.
> 
> ## 4. Target Audience
> 
> - **Primary:** CISOs, IT Directors, and Business Continuity leaders.
> - **Secondary:** CIOs and business executives who need to understand the shift in risk landscape.
> 
> ## 5. Lead Magnet Suggestion
> 
> - **Title:** The Disaster Recovery vs. Cyber Resilience Scorecard
> - **Content:** A simple scorecard that helps organizations evaluate their current BCDR plan against the principles of cyber resilience, highlighting key gaps.
