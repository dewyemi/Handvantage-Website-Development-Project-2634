> - **Example:** Provide a concrete example with numbers (e.g., saving 15 minutes per alert).
> - **Closing Sentence:** "Gains Analysis transforms the conversation about automation from a vague promise of ‘efficiency’ into a concrete, data-driven business case that any CFO can understand."
> 
> ## 3. Key Insights from Research
> 
> - **The "Efficiency" Trap:** Many security leaders struggle to get budget for automation because "efficiency" is too vague. The Gains Analysis Framework provides a structured way to translate efficiency into measurable financial terms.
> - **Identify:** Start by identifying a repetitive, manual task (e.g., triaging phishing alerts).
> - **Measure Pain:** Quantify the cost of the manual process. For example, if it takes an analyst 15 minutes to triage a phishing alert and they handle 40 alerts per day, that's 10 hours of work per day.
> - **Automate:** Implement an automation playbook to handle the task.
> - **Measure Gain:** Measure the time saved. If the playbook reduces the triage time to 1 minute, you have saved 9.3 hours per day. Multiply this by the analyst's hourly rate to get the direct cost savings.
> 
> ## 4. Target Audience

> - **Primary:** SOC Managers, Security Operations leaders, and CISOs.
> - **Secondary:** Financial executives and business leaders who approve security budgets.
