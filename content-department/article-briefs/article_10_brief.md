> 
> - **Core Concept:** Use a real-world example of a breach caused by a leaked API key (e.g., the 2023 breach of a major cloud provider or a recent supply chain attack).
> - **Attack Chain:** Detail the attack chain, from the initial leak of the key (e.g., in a public GitHub repository) to the final data exfiltration.
> - **Lessons Learned:** Conclude with clear, actionable lessons learned for other organizations.

> 
> - **The Prevalence of the Problem:** 87% of organizations have experienced an identity-centric breach in the last year. Leaked secrets are a common vector.
> - **The Machine Identity Blind Spot:** The leaked API key is a machine identity, which is often unmanaged and lacks the security controls applied to human identities.
> - **The Cost:** Frame the breach in terms of its financial impact (multi-million dollar cost) and reputational damage.
> - **The Solution:** Connect the lessons learned back to the concepts of an Identity Fabric and the COLOR framework for machine identity management.
