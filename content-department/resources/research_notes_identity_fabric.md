**Date:** April 23, 2025

### Key Statistics - The 82:1 Problem

**Machine vs Human Identity Ratio:**
- **82 machine identities for every human** in organizations worldwide
- **42% of machine identities have privileged or sensitive access**
- **88% of respondents** say the definition of 'privileged user' applies solely to human identities (ignoring machines)
- **61% do not have identity security controls** in place to secure cloud infrastructure and workloads

**Breach Statistics:**
- **87% of organizations experienced at least two successful identity-centric breaches** in the past 12 months
- Breach types include: supply chain attacks, compromised privileged access, identity and credential theft

**AI and Identity Security:**
- **68% say their organizations lack identity security controls for AI**
- **47% cannot secure shadow AI usage** in their organization
- AI is expected to drive the creation of the **greatest number of new identities with privileged and sensitive access in 2025**
- AI agent adoption roadblocks include manipulation and sensitive access concerns

**Identity Silos and Complexity:**
- **70% of respondents say identity silos are a root cause** of organizational cybersecurity risk
- **75% of security professionals agree** that their organizations prioritize business efficiencies over robust cybersecurity
- **Human and machine identities are expected to double in 2025**
- **88% of respondents are under increased pressure from insurers** mandating enhanced privilege controls

**Financial Sector Specific:**
- For every human employee in financial sector, there are **96 machine identities** (higher than the 82:1 average across other sectors)

### Key Insights from CyberArk Chief Strategy Officer

**Clarence Hinton, Chief Strategy Officer at CyberArk:**
> "The race to embed AI into environments has inadvertently created a new set of identity security risks centered around the access of unmanaged and unsecured machine identities – and the privileged access of AI agents will represent an entirely new threat vector. To stay resilient, CISOs and security leaders must modernize their identity security strategies to contend with a new and expanding attack surface characterized by the proliferation of identities with privileged access and made worse by damaging identity silos."

### Report Methodology
- Conducted by Vanson Bourne
- **2,600 cybersecurity decision makers** surveyed
- Organizations of **500+ employees** (private and public sector)
- **20 countries:** Brazil, Canada, Mexico, US, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, UK, UAE, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Australia, India, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, Singapore, Taiwan

### Content Angles for Articles

**The 82:1 Problem:**
- Human-centric security (MFA, password policies) only addresses 1% of the identity landscape
- 99% of digital workforce (machines) left dangerously exposed
- Machine identities include: API keys, service accounts, certificates, tokens, secrets

**Why Machine Identity Management Matters:**
- Cloud and AI are primary drivers of machine identity proliferation
- Nearly half of machine identities have sensitive or privileged access
- Traditional IAM systems were designed for humans, not machines
- Machine identities don't have MFA, password policies, or human oversight

**The Identity Silo Problem:**
- 70% say silos are root cause of cybersecurity risk
- Fragmented identity security programs diminish resilience
- Poor environmental visibility prevents effective security
- Need for unified identity fabric to break down silos

**Business vs Security Tension:**
- 75% prioritize business efficiencies over robust cybersecurity
- This creates dangerous gaps in identity security
- Need to frame identity security as business enabler, not blocker

### Questions for Further Research
- What is an Identity Fabric architecture specifically?
- How does Identity Fabric relate to Zero Trust?
- What is the COLOR framework for machine identity lifecycle?
- What are best practices for securing API keys and service accounts?
- How do you implement centralized identity governance without becoming a bottleneck?
